	<h1>API Key Instructions</h1>
	<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/utspzci.png">Create an API key</a> at <b>https://account.arena.net/applications</b> and paste it in the input boxes above in order to view your GW2 account's data.</p>
	<h1>Privacy Statement</h2>
	<p>Last changed on: 2016-02-01</p>
	<p>Knowing an API key allows anyone to view your account's ingame information, such as: characters and guilds, bank and inventory contents, gold and assets, achievements and unlocks, and Trading Post and PvP match history. You may limit which of these type of information is exposed when creating an API key, and remove access to these information by deleting the API key at the ArenaNet website.</p>
	<p>GW2Timer.com <strong>does not</strong> view, store, collect, or datamine API keys or the information API keys provide. When you enter the API key into the website, you are performing calculations locally on your computer, and the keys are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_storage">stored</a> in your web browser, not a server.</p>
	<p>GW2Timer.com uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics#Privacy_issues">Google Analytics</a> and is able to view and store text that is shown on your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_bar">address bar</a> when you are on this website. If you do not wish to expose your API key, do not put your API key in the browser address bar.</p>
